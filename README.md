This application is based on [jdretz's rapid-api weather app tutorial](https://github.com/jdretz/rapid-api-react-weather-app-tutorial), then adapted for native JavaScript and bootstrapped with Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by Shardul Vaidya.

## Quickstart guide

The main logic for getting weather forecasts exists in `/src/components/Forecast/Forecast.js`.
Place your API key in the root of the project in a file called `.env` in a variable called `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<insert API Key>`.
